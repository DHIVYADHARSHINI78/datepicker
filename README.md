This is a React web app that helps people create and manage repeating schedules like daily tasks or weekly events.It lets users choose a start and end date, how often it should repeat (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), and even add notes for each schedule.I built the UI using React and styled it with Tailwind CSS to keep it clean and responsive.
The core logic uses React Context, which makes it easy to share and manage state across different components without prop drilling.Users can save, edit, and delete schedules, and also preview them on a calendar.
Overall, itâ€™s a simple but powerful tool to organize routines like meetings, study plans, or personal reminders.
